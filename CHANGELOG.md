# Change Log

You can find the complete detailled changelog for every beta release [here](https://github.com/homebridge-eufy-security/plugin/releases).

## 2.2.0-beta.17 - latest changes

### Changed

- eufy-security-client library is now added as forked dependency to enable direct changes

### Fixed

- Trying to fix login issue #250
- Fixed installation issues with previous betas
- Package size was dramatically reduced by removing cache files

## 2.2.0 (Beta)

### Added

- HomeKit Secure Video (HKSV) Support (see #6)
- Experimental Mode
- Experimental Mode Option: Enabling RTSP streaming on all devices (e.g. Doorbells can now stream via RTSP)
- Plugin will show warnings if it encounters a captcha or 2FA request while logging in.

- Setting to add a switch to turn indoor chime on/off on some doorbells
- Setting for mono/stereo talkback configuration (needed for certain devices)

### Changed

- If HomeKit Secure Video is enabled, motion detection will not work while a recording is active. This is due to technical limitations for now. (see #6)
- Removed livestream caching (a.k.a `useCachedLocalLivestream`) since the continued streaming could cause issues with HKSV and motion detection in general
- Overhauled design of advanced video config
- Improved verbose output for snapshot and ffmpeg processes
- Added explanatory description to snapshot handling method.
- Updated to latest dependency: eufy-security-client
- Warn the user if multiple cameras are connected through the same station and limit critical options for these cameras (snapshot method and HKSV)
- Log errors in command results from eufy-security-client library to homebridge
- Removed overhead in stream processing improve performance
- eufy-security-client library is now added as forked dependency to enable direct changes

### Fixed

- Switches to turn camera and motion on/off should now be removed from HomeKit if the user switches the configuration
- Bug where no snapshot was returned after an event
- Bug that caused a crash with node version prior to v14.18
- Talkback was not working properly due to wrong channel configuration (can now be chosen: mono/stereo) #196

## 2.1.0 (RC)

### Added

- Talkback support #103
- Improved snapshot handling: 3 different snapshot methods
- Feature to improve camera snapshots at night (night vision)
- Feature to automatically generate camera snapshots a given period of time, so that snapshots are more up-to-date
- Feature allowing enabling and disabling motion detection throug switch if camera is used as a motion sensor only
- Feature allowing enabling and disabling the camera throug switch even if camera is used as a motion sensor only
- Control Station alarm through HomeKit (reset the alarm and even trigger it with HomeKit automations. You can now trigger the alarm even with third party accessories - e.g. with devices from vendors other than eufy) - see #26
- Feature to download log files through plugin configuration ui
- Setting to disable log file storage to disk (possible fix for #93)
- Setting to choose that separate ffmpeg processes for audio and video streaming will be used (this can increase performance)
- Setting to choose audio sample rate
- Presets (`copy`, `performance`) for advanced video config

### Changed

- Complete redesign of the config ui screen
- RTSP setting is now only avaiable on compatible devices
- Updated to latest version of eufy-security-client (2.1.2) (fix for #72 and #38)
- Refactored whole project structure to resemble the new workspace layout (plugin + custom ui)
- Reimplementation of device discovery algorithm to better reflect best practices mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client/issues/167#issuecomment-1155388624)
- Added timeouts for guard mode changes. If these fail HomeKit will no longer get stuck, trying to change the guard mode and an error will be written to the log output (see #39)
- Limit value for maximum streaming duration to prevent unexpected behaviour (see #111)
- Additional debug messages to help with issues
- Updated repo funding details (Readme.md and package.json)
- Cleaned up dependencies
- Using tslog instead of bunyan for logging of eufy-security-client messages since bunyan would not print deep nested objects correctly
- Logging for eufy-security-client is moved to separate log file: `eufy-log.log`
- Refactored handling of ffmpeg processes
- Deprecated option `forcerefreshsnap` was removed and will no longer be evaluated - use `snapshotHandlingMethod` instead

### Fixed

- Plugin crashed if station was disarmed with certain configured guard modes
- Config ui crash due to a wrong node version requirement (#44)
- Livestream could not be started if previous local livestream cache was not shut down correctly (e.g. #43)
- Livestream was not working if videoconfig was populated with empty values

- Options enableCamera and enableMotion were not working in specific configuration situations (see #48)

- Fix issue that streams were only rendered in 640x480 - see #46
- Fixed smartlocks - see #110
