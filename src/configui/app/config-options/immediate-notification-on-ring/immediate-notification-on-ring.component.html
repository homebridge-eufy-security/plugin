    In general Homekit will try to get a snapshot to show it in it's push notifications. Since the process
    to genereate a snapshot takes some time the push notification will be delayed by this time difference.
    This option allows to generate an empty snapshot on ringing events to speed up the push notification.
    This can safe up to 10 seconds between the event and the corresponding notification on your device.<br />
    <b>This option however delivers most likely an empty (black) snapshot on those events!</b>
